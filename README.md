##Synopsis
This is an easy way to add a quick pre-submission confirmation page to your forms where users can preview their entered data before it is submitted. Gravity Forms does not provide any way to do this by default; however, with this plugin and a few simple form configuration instructions, you’ll have pre-submission confirmations working like magic!

###Features

* Adds a quick pre-submission confirmation page to Gravity Forms.
* No configurations; Just Plugin & Play!

##Installation:

1. Upload `gravity-pre-submission-confirmation` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from Admin > Plugins menu.
3. Add a page at the end of the form for the pre-submission confirmation. You can do this using the Page Break field type within Gravity Forms.
3. Add an HTML field from the “Standard Fields” section.
4. The easiest way is to add {all_fields} to this section. But if you need more customizations, go ahead and select the HTML field for editing. The 'Content' setting of this field now supports all merge tags like {Name (First):4}, {Question:5}.
6. Update the Gravity form.
